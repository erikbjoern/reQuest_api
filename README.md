## ENDPOINTS

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`

### /requests

#### GET /requests

The get request will return all the *pending* requests in the database.
Offerable is null if auth headers are not included, and false if the request is created by, or has an offer from, current user. True otherwise.
If params: { coordinates: { lat: 1.4, long: 4.2 } } are included and geovalid, the distance from request coordinates is served as a float in km, otherwise distance: nil.
The format is, in *descending* order by id, meaning newest first:

```
{
  requests: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Title",
      description: "Lots of text",
      requester: "requester@mail.com",
      category: "home",
      reward: 100,
      offerable: true,
      distance: 1.2
    },
    {
      id: 2,
      title: "Titly",
      description: "Lots of texts",
      requester: "me@mail.com",
      category: "it",
      reward: 120
      offerable: false
      distance: 3.1
    }
  ]
}
```

### my_request/

#### GET my_request/requests/:id

```
{
  "request": {
    "id": 1597,
    "title": "I need help with this",
    "description": "This is what I need help with",
    "reward": 100,
    "status":"pending"
    "offers": [
      {
        "id": 1,
        "email": "person1@example.com",
        "status": "pending"
        "conversation: {
          "messages": [
            {
              "content": "asd",
              "me": true
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      {
        "id": 2,
        "email": "person2@example.com"
        "status": "declined"
        "conversation": {...}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Targeting a request that you're not the owner of, renders 422 and error message:

```
{ "message": "This is not your reQuest" }
```

#### POST my_request/requests

To create a new request you need to include authentication headers.
You also need to provide :title=String and :description=String, and may provide category.
Valid categories are "other", "education", "home", "it", "sport", "vehicles". Other is default if none is provided.
You need to provide the parameter coords: { long: 55.3, lat, 33.1 }. Both are floats.
Long is valid between -180 and +180, lat is valid between -90 and +90.
The response will be a 200 with a message and the id of the created resource.

```
{ message: 'Your reQuest was successfully created!', id: <resource_id>, karma_points: <users karma_points> }
```

If auth is missing, devise will throw the following with 401:

```
{"errors": ["You need to sign in or sign up before continuing."]}
```

If a param, e.g. description and reward is missing, or reward is negative or not a number, you will get 422:

```
{ message: 'Description can't be blank and Reward can't be blank' }
```

If a non-valid category is supplied you will get 422:

```
{ message: "'non-valid-category' is not a valid category" }
```

If a non-permitted param is sent, you will get 422:

```
{ message: 'found unpermitted parameter: :body' }
```

If reQuester dont have enough karma points:
{ message: You dont have enough karma points }

All devise endpoints are available at /auth.
